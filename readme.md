# Hello!
This is the second app created while learning js. 
You can use it to calculate the cost of a journey on a route.

**To use the app you need to enter:**

* the price of fuel per litre
* average fuel consumption of the vehicle per 100 * kilometres
* the length of the route in kilometres

You can make the calculation by clicking on the button, or by pressing enter ðŸ˜‰
